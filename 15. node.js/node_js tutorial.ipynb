    "## What is node.js?\n",
    "It is open source, corss platform **runtime environment for executing Javascript code outside the browser**. It is **not a programming langueage or a framework**. We use it to create backend services called API's or Application Programming Interfaces. These are the services that power the client application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node is suitable for building highly scalable data intensive and real time backend services. It is highly scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use javascript in both frontend and backend, so consitent and cleaner code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node architecture\n",
    "Before node.js javascript was used to run only inside the browser, and every browser has a **javascript engine** which converts JS code to machine code. For example, **Chakra** in Microsoft edge, **Spidermonkey** in Firefox and **V8** in Chrome. Due to different JS engine, the JS code produces different results in different browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2009 Rhan Dhal took V8 JS engine and embedded it in C++ program, and called it node,exe. So it has JS engine to execute the JS code and also has certain object that provide an environment for our JS code. These objects are different form environment objects we have in browser like working with the file system and listening to http requests, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How node.js works\n",
    "Node applications are highly scalable and this is because of the non-blocking or asynchronous nature of node. A single thread is used to handle multiple requests. In contrast to non-blocking or asynchronous architecture we have blocking or synchronous architecture where we receive a request on the server, a thread is allocated to handle that request and is likely   that we're going to query a database and as you know sometimes it may take a little while until the result is ready. When the database is executing the query that thread is sitting there waiting it can't be used to serve another client so we need a new thread to serve another\n",
    "client. \n",
    "\n",
    "After request is processed, it puts a message in what we call an event queue. Node is continuously monitoring this queue in the background, when it finds an event in this queue, it\n",
    "will take it out and process it. This kind of architecture makes node ideal for building applications that include a lot of disk or network access we can serve more clients without the need to throw in more hardware, and that's why node applications are highly scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast node should not be used for CPU intensive applications like a video encoding or an image manipulation service in this kind of applications we have a lot of calculations that should be done by CPU and few operations that touch the file system or the network since no the applications are single threaded when performing the calculations to serve one client,   other clients have to wait and that's why **node should not be used for CPU intensive applications it should only be used for data intensive and real time application.**\n"

    "}\n",
    "sayHello('Deepanjan');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Node.js does not have a window or document object, these are just the part of runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## node module system\n",
    "1. **Global scope:**  \n",
    "These objects can be accessed in any files. For example: console.log(), setTimeout(), clearTimeout(), setInterval(), clearInterval(), etc. All these functions **belong to the global object**. So we can also write, *global.console.log()*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modularity\n",
    "In order to build codes in node, we use modularity. So two variables/functions with the same name will not override the each others definition. Modularity means writing code in different files (Every .js file is considered a module) and all functions and variable defined in those functions are local/private to that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the function or variable outside the module, we explicitly export the function/variable outside the module. To see all the contents of the module we use `console.log(module);` which returns a JSON object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export variables and functions outside the local scope to global scope we use, exports property of module i.e, **module.exports**.\n",
    "\n",

    "Also, `console.log(files2);` displays all the fucntions and variables exported from the file.  \n",

    "## What is express.js\n",
    "1. HTTP module was used to create a web server that listens on port and responds to requests for these endpoints.\n",
    "2. While this approach is perfectly fine it's not ideal for building a complex application because in a large complex application we might have various endpoints and we don't want to hard-code all these if statements in this function. 3. We're going to look at Express which is a fast and lightweight framework for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RESTful API\n",
    "1. App itself is the client or the front-end part under the hood it needs to talk to a server or the back-end to get or save the data this communication happens using the HTTP protocol.\n",
    "2. On the server we expose a bunch of services that are accessible via the HTTP protocol the client can then directly call the services by sending HTTP requests.\n",
    "3. This is where REST comes into the picture. REST is short for **representational state transfer**.\n",
    "4. REST is basically a convention for building these HTTP services so we use simple HTTP protocol principles to provide support to **create read update and delete data we refer to these operations all together as crud operations**.\n",
    "5. There are various types of http request, which determines the kind of operation. Every HTTP request has a verb or method associated with it.\n",
    "6. Types of HTTP Requests are:\n",
    "    1. **GET:** for getting data. Eg: **`/api/courses`** will return array of course objects and **`/api/courses/math`** will return specific course object.\n",
    "    2. **POST:** for creating data. Eg: **`/api/courses`** will create new course object and course object should be part of body of request.\n",
    "    3. **PUT:** for updating data. Eg: **`/api/courses/math`** will update specific course object and updated course object should be part of body of request.\n",
    "    4. **DELETE:** for deleting the data. Eg: **`/api/courses/math`** will delete specific course object and body of request need not have course object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Express.js\n",
    "1. **express.js** is a framework. It provides a proper structure so that we can apply more routes easily while keeping the application maintainable.\n",
    "2. Create a new folder for the project, go to the folder in cmd line and type `npm init --yes` after this we will have package.json file. Then we can install express as `npm i express`.\n",
    "3. To load the module, we use: `const express = require('express');`. It returns a function.\n",
    "4. Then we use: `const app = express();`, where app is the object.\n",
    "5. We have 4 main methods to handle 4 type of requests i.e, `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()` and `app.delete()`.\n",
    "7. `app.listen(3000,() => {colsole.log('listening on port 3000');});` will listen on port 3000.\n",
    "8. **Note:** It is not necessary that port 3000 will be availabel in the production environment. So we use the environment variable called PORT to determine which port to host the server. It is done using:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n",
    "app.listen(port,() => {colsole.log(`listening on port ${port}`);});\n",
    "```\n",
    "9. Install **`nodemon`** module, which is node monitor, which tracks a file and whenever file changes then nodemon will restart the server. So we need not necessarily stop the server and manually restart it. We can start our application using `nodemon filename.js`."
