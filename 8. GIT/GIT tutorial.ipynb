    "**Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.** It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a\n",
    "previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What people usually do when not using VCS.\n",
    "Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps atime-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Centralized Version Control Systems\n",
    "The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with this problem, **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs)** were developed. **These systems have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Central version control](CVS.png)\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "* everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing.\n",
    "* Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what, and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantage\n",
    "* The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they’re working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributed Version Control Systems\n",
    "In Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) such as Git, **clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history.** Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, **any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to\n",
    "restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.** These systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with."

    "## Snapshots, Not Differences\n",
    "Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the **information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).**\n",
    "\n",
    "![delta based VCS](delta-based-VCS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a **series of\n",
    "snapshots of a miniature filesystem.** With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your\n",
    "project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and **stores a\n",
    "reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again,\n",
    "just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.** Git thinks about its data more like a\n",
    "stream of snapshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "![git VCS](git_VCS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nearly Every Operation Is Local\n",
    "Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your network. For example, to browse the history of the project, Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you — it simply reads it directly from your local database. This means you\n",
    "see the project history almost instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that there is very little you can’t do if you’re offline or off VPN. If you get on an airplane or a train and want to do a little work, you can commit happily (to your local copy, remember?) until you get to a network connection to upload.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git Has Integrity\n",
    "** in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum.** This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. **You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git Generally Only Adds Data\n",
    "When you do actions in Git, **nearly all of them only add data to the Git database.** It is hard to get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. After you commit a snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Three States\n",
    "Git has three main states that your files can reside in. **committed, modified, and staged**:\n",
    "* Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.\n",
    "* Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.\n",
    "* Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the 3 main sections of a Git project: **the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area.**\n",
    "The basic Git workflow goes something like this:\n",
    "1. You modify files in your **working tree.**\n",
    "2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the **staging area.**\n",
    "3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your **Git directory.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## First-Time Git Setup\n",
    "Git comes with a tool called **`git config`** that lets you **get and set configuration variables** that control\n",
    "all aspects of how Git looks and operates. You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they’ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Identity\n",
    "The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n",
    ">>> git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, **because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system.** If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking Your Settings\n",
    "If you want to check your configuration settings, you can use the **`git config --list` command** to list all the settings Git can find at that point. You can also check what Git thinks a specific key’s value is by typing **`git config <key>`**:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> git config user.name\n",
    "John Doe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Help\n",
    "If you ever need help while using Git, there are two equivalent ways to get the comprehensive manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> git help <verb>\n",
    ">>> man git-<verb>\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example, you can get the manpage help for the git config command by running $\\text{git help config}$."

    "## Removing Files\n",
    "To remove a file from Git, you have to **remove it from your tracked files** (more accurately, remove it from your staging area) **and then commit**. The **`git rm` command** does that, and **also removes the file from your working directory** so you don’t see it as an untracked file the next time around. If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the “Changes not staged for commit” (that is, unstaged) area of your git status output:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> rm PROJECTS.md\n",

    "deleted: PROJECTS.md\n",
    "no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, if you run **`git rm` command**, it stages the file’s removal:\n",

    "To rename a file in Git, it has a mv command.\n",
    "```\n",

If you’ve made no changes since your last commit then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you’ll change is your commit message. The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous commit. You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit. As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit, you can do something like this:\n",

    "Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify -a when you run the tag command:\n",
    "`>>> git tag -a v1.4 -m \"my version 1.4\"`  \n",
    "**The -m specifies a tagging message**, which is stored with the tag. If you don’t specify a message for an annotated tag, Git launches your editor so you can type it in.  \n",
    "You can see the tag data along with the commit that was tagged by using the **`git show` command**:\n",

    ">>> git branch\n",
    "iss53\n",
    "* master\n",
    "testing\n",
    "```\n",
    "To see last commit in each branch run the command **`git branch -v`**\n",

    "```\n",

    "![divergent history](divergent_history.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see this easily with the git log command. If you run **`git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all`** it will print out the history of your commits.\n",

    "![rebased commit](rebased_commit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge.\n",
