    "## What is HTML?\n",
    "HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.\n",
    "1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language\n",
    "2. HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup\n",
    "3. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages\n",
    "4. HTML elements are represented by tags\n",
    "5. HTML tags label pieces of content such as \"heading\", \"paragraph\", \"table\", and so on\n",
    "6. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <title>Page Title</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <h1>My First Heading</h1>\n",
    "    <p>My first paragraph.</p>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web Browsers:\n",
    "**The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration:\n",
    "**The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.** It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags). **The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.**"

    "## HTML Basics:\n",
    "1. The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`.\n",
    "2. The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>`. \n",
    "3. HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. `<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.\n",
    "4. HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag.\n",
    "5. HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag. The link's destination is specified in the `href` attribute. \n",
    "6. HTML images are defined with the `<img>` tag. The source file (`src`), alternative text (`alt`), width, and height are provided as attributes.\n",
    "7. HTML buttons are defined with the `<button>` tag.\n",
    "8. HTML lists are defined with the `<ul>` (unordered/bullet list) or the `<ol>` (ordered/numbered list) tag, followed by `<li>` tags (list items).\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between. For example: `<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>`\n",
    "2. **Empty HTML Elements:** HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. For example: `<br>` is an empty element without a closing tag. Empty elements can be \"closed\" in the opening tag like this: `<br />` (**Recommended**).\n",
    "3. **HTML tags are not case sensitive**, `<P>` means the same as `<p>`. The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase tags, but **W3C recommends lowercase in HTML**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All HTML elements can have attributes\n",
    "2. Attributes provide additional information about an element\n",
    "3. Attributes are always specified in the start tag\n",
    "4. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name=\"value\"\n",
    "5. The style attribute is used to specify the styling of an element, like color, font, size etc.\n",
    "6. Here, a **`title`** attribute is added to the `<p>` element.\n",
    "7. **The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase attribute names but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML.**\n",
    "8. W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.\n",
    "2. `<h1>` defines the most important heading.\n",
    "3. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.\n",
    "4. Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.\n",
    "5. Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS `**font-size**` property. For example: `<h1 style=\"font-size:60px;\">Heading 1</h1>`.\n",
    "6. The `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph.\n",
    "2. The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed\n",
    "3. The HTML `<br>` element defines a line break. **Use `<br>` if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.**\n",
    "4. The HTML `<pre>` element defines **preformatted text**. The text inside a `<pre>` element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), **and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.**"

    "## The HTML Style Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute. The HTML style attribute has the following syntax: `<tagname style=\"property:value;\">`. **The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value.**\n",
    "2. The `background-color` property defines the background color for an HTML element.\n",
    "3. The `color` property defines the text color for an HTML element.\n",
    "4. The `font-family` property defines the font to be used for an HTML element.\n",
    "5. The `font-size` property defines the text size for an HTML element.\n",
    "6. The `text-align` property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Text Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The HTML `<b>` element defines bold text, without any extra importance.\n",
    "2. The HTML `<i>` element defines italic text, without any extra importance.\n",
    "3. The HTML `<sub>` element defines subscripted text.\n",
    "4. The HTML `<sup>` element defines superscripted text.\n",
    "3. he HTML `<small>` element defines smaller text.\n",
    "4. The HTML `<mark>` element defines marked or highlighted text:\n",
    "5. The HTML `<del>` element defines deleted (removed) text.\n",
    "6. The HTML `<ins>` element defines inserted (added) text.\n",
    "7. The HTML `<abbr>` element defines an abbreviation or an acronym. For example: ` <p>The <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p> `\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Comment Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax: `<!-- Write your comments here -->`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Styling HTML with CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.\n",
    "2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.\n",
    "3. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.\n",
    "4. CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:\n",
    "    1. Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements\n",
    "    2. Internal - by using a `<style>` element in the `<head>` section\n",
    "    3. External - by using an external CSS file. The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in separate CSS files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inline CSS:** ` <h1 style=\"color:blue;\">This is a Blue Heading</h1>`  \n",
    "**Internal CSS:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "<style>\n",
    "body {background-color: powderblue;}\n",

    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n",

    "\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html> \n",
    "```\n",
    "** The id Attribute:**\n",
    "To define a specific style for one special element, add an id attribute to the element. For example: \n",
    "`<p id=\"p01\">I am different</p>`\n",
    "\n",
    "** The class Attribute:**\n",
    "To define a style for special types of elements, add a class attribute to the element. For example:\n",
    "`<p class=\"error\">I am different</p>`"

    "## HTML Links - Hyperlinks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HTML links are hyperlinks.\n",
    "2. You can click on a link and jump to another document.\n",
    "3. In HTML, links are defined with the `<a>` tag: `<a href=\"url\">link text</a>`. The **link text** is the visible part of the hyperlink.\n",
    "4. Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.\n",
    "5. A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without `https://www....`).\n",
    "6. The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. The target attribute can have one of the following values:\n",
    "    1. _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab\n",
    "    2. _self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)\n",
    "    3. _parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame\n",
    "    4. _top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window\n",
    "    5. framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame\n",
    "7. The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Images:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In HTML, images are defined with the `<img>` tag.\n",
    "2. The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.\n",
    "3. The **src attribute** specifies the URL (web address) of the image.\n",
    "4. The **alt attribute** provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it.\n",
    "5. You can **use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image**. For example: ` <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" alt=\"Girl in a jacket\" style=\"width:500px;height:600px;\"> `. Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes, **However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images.**\n",
    "6. **Images on Another Server:** Some web sites store their images on image servers. Actually, you can access images from any web address in the world. Example: `<img src=\"https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg\" alt=\"W3Schools.com\">`\n",
    "7. To add a background image on an HTML element, **use the CSS property background-image**. Example: `<body style=\"background-image:url('clouds.jpg');\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unordered HTML List**:  \n",
    "An unordered list starts with the `<ul>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "  <li>Tea</li>\n",
    "  <li>Milk</li>\n",
    "</ul> \n",
    "```\n",
    "The type property is used to define the style of the list item marker:\n",
    "   Value \tDescription\n",
    "1. disc \tSets the list item marker to a bullet (default)\n",
    "2. circle \tSets the list item marker to a circle\n",
    "3. square \tSets the list item marker to a square\n",
    "4. none \tThe list items will not be marked\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordered HTML List:**  \n",
    "An ordered list starts with the `<ol>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "  <li>Tea</li>\n",
    "  <li>Milk</li>\n",
    "</ol> \n",
    "```\n",
    "The type attribute of the `<ol>` tag, defines the type of the list item marker:\n",
    "   Type \tDescription\n",
    "1. type=\"1\" \tThe list items will be numbered with numbers (default)\n",
    "2. type=\"A\" \tThe list items will be numbered with uppercase letters\n",
    "3. type=\"a\" \tThe list items will be numbered with lowercase letters\n",
    "4. type=\"I\" \tThe list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers\n",
    "5. type=\"i\" \tThe list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Block and Inline Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. **The default display value for most elements is block or inline.**\n",
    "1. **Block-level Elements:** A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). The `<div>` element is a block-level element. The `<div>` element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.\n",
    "2. **Inline Elements:** An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. This is an inline `<span>` element inside a paragraph. The `<span>` element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML class attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The HTML class attribute is used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name.\n",
    "2. In CSS, to select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class. For example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "<style>\n",
    ".city {\n",
    "  background-color: tomato;\n",
    "  color: white;\n",
    "  padding: 10px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "</style>\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. HTML elements can have more than one class name, each class name must be separated by a space. For exmaple:\n",
    "`<h2 class=\"city main\">London</h2>` is part of multiple classes i.e, **class city** and **class main**.\n",
    "4. JavaScript can access elements with a specified class name by using the **getElementsByClassName()** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML id attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element** (the value must be unique within the HTML document).\n",
    "2. The id value can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for a unique element with the specified id value.\n",
    "3. **In CSS, to select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.**\n",
    "4. **An HTML element can only have one unique id that belongs to that single element, while a class name can be used by multiple elements.**\n",
    "5. JavaScript can access an element with a specified id by using the **`getElementById()`** method."

    "## HTML Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An HTML table is defined with the `<table>` tag.\n",
    "2. Each table row is defined with the `<tr>` tag.\n",
    "3. A table header is defined with the `<th>` tag. By default, table headings are bold and centered. \n",
    "4. A table data/cell is defined with the `<td>` tag.\n",
    "5. To make a cell span more than one column, use the **`colspan`** attribute.\n",
    "6. To make a cell span more than one row, use the **`rowspan`** attribute:\n",
    "7. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style=\"width:100%\">\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <th>Firstname</th>\n",
    "    <th>Lastname</th>\n",
    "    <th>Age</th>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>Jill</td>\n",
    "    <td>Smith</td>\n",
    "    <td>50</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>Eve</td>\n",
    "    <td>Jackson</td>\n",
    "    <td>94</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table> \n",
    "\n",
    "8. To add a caption to a table, use the `<caption>` tag. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style=\"width:100%\">\n",
    "  <caption>Monthly savings</caption>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <th>Month</th>\n",
    "    <th>Savings</th>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>January</td>\n",
    "    <td>100</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>February</td>\n",
    "    <td>50</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `<script>` tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).\n",
    "2. The `<script>` element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.\n",
    "3. **Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.**\n",
    "4. To select an HTML element, JavaScript very often uses the **`document.getElementById()`** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML File Paths:\n",
    "| Path | Description |\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "|`<img src=\"picture.jpg\">`|\tpicture.jpg is located in the same folder as the current page|\n",
    "|`<img src=\"images/picture.jpg\">`|picture.jpg is located in the images folder in the current folder|\n",
    "|`<img src=\"/images/picture.jpg\">`|picture.jpg is located in the images folder at the root of the current web|\n",
    "|`<img src=\"../picture.jpg\">`|picture.jpg is located in the folder one level up from the current folder|\n",
    "\n",
    "## The HTML `<head>` Element:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `<head>` element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag. Metadata is not displayed.\n",
    "2. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.\n",
    "3. The following tags describe metadata: `<title>`, `<style>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, and `<base>`.\n",
    "4. **HTML `<base>` Element:** The `<base>` element specifies the base URL and base target for all relative URLs in a page. For example: `<base href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/images/\" target=\"_blank\">`"

    "## HTML Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML `<form>` element defines a form that is used to collect user input. Form elements are different types of input elements, like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Action Attribute::** The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. Normally, the form data is sent to a web page on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Target Attribute:** The target attribute specifies if the submitted result will open in a new browser tab, a frame, or in the current window. The default value is \"_self\" which means the form will be submitted in the current window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Method Attribute:** The method attribute specifies the **HTTP method (GET or POST)** to be used when submitting the form data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use GET:** The default method when submitting form data is GET. However, when GET is used, the submitted form data will be visible in the page address field:\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use POST:** Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information. The POST method does not display the submitted form data in the page address field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Form Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The `<input>` Element:** The most important form element is the `<input>` element and can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.\n",
    "2. **The `<select>` Element:** The `<select>` element defines a drop-down list. The `<option>` elements defines an option that can be selected. By default, the first item in the drop-down list is selected.\n",
    "    **Syntax:**  \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    <select name=\"cars\">\n",
    "      <option value=\"volvo\">Volvo</option>\n",
    "      <option value=\"saab\">Saab</option>\n",
    "      <option value=\"fiat\">Fiat</option>\n",
    "      <option value=\"audi\">Audi</option>\n",
    "    </select> \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    To define a pre-selected option, add the selected attribute to the option. For example: `<option value=\"fiat\" selected>Fiat</option>`\n",
    "    Use the size attribute to specify the number of visible values. For example: `<select name=\"cars\" size=\"3\">`\n",
    "3. **The `<textarea>` Element:** The `<textarea>` element defines a multi-line input field (a text area). For example:\n",
    "`<textarea name=\"message\" rows=\"10\" cols=\"30\"> The cat was playing in the garden. </textarea>` \n",
    "4. **The `<button>` Element:** The `<button>` element defines a clickable button. For example: `<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"alert('Hello World!')\">Click Me!</button>`\n",
    "\n",
