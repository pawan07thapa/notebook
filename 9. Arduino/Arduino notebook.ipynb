    "### About Arduino:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arduino is a prototype platform (open-source) based on an easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a circuit board, which can be programed (referred to as a microcontroller) and a ready-made software called Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is used to write and upload the computer code to the physical board.\n",
    "2. Arduino does not need an extra piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load a new code onto the board. You can simply use a USB cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Board description:\n",

    "* Power USB (1)\n",
    "* Power (Barrel Jack) (2)\n",
    "* Voltage Regulator (3)\n",
    "* Crystal Oscillator (4)\n",
    "* Arduino Reset (5,17)\n",
    "* Vin (9): This pin also can be used to power the Arduino board from an external power source, like AC mains power supply.\n",
    "* Analog pins (10)\n",
    "* Microcontroller (11)\n",
    "* ICSP pin (12): It is an AVR, a tiny programming header for the Arduino consisting of **MOSI, MISO, SCK, RESET, VCC, and GND.** It is often referred to as an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), which could be considered as an \"expansion\" of the output. Actually, you are slaving the output device to the master of the SPI bus.\n",
    "* Power LED indicator (13): This LED should light up when you plug your Arduino into a power source to indicate that your board is powered up correctly.\n",
    "* TX and RX LEDs (14)\n",
    "* Digital I / O (15): The Arduino UNO board has 14 digital I/O pins (15) (of which 6 provide PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output.\n",
    "* AREF (16): AREF stands for Analog Reference. It is sometimes, used to set an external reference voltage (between 0 and 5 Volts) as the upper limit for the analog input pins.\n",

    "1. Setup( ) function: The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialize the variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc. The setup function will only run once, after each power up or reset of the Arduino board.\n",
    "2. Loop( ) function: After creating a setup() function, which initializes and sets the initial values, the loop() function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. Use it to actively control the Arduino board.\n",
