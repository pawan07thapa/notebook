    "# 1. What is Powershell?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is automated framework with Command Line Interface and object oriented scripting Langueage.\n",
    "2. It automates repetitive tasks.\n",
    "3. **Any task we perform using GUI in Windows works with some Powershell command in the backend.**\n",
    "4. The powershell cmdlets are always in Verb-Noun format and Noun is always Singular Noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Windows Management Framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Powershell comes preinstalled in windows as a part of Windows Management Framework (WMF) along with WinRM (WIndows Remote Management) and BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service).\n",
    "* Get-Host can be used to get the powershell version."

    "# 3. Some Useful commands:\n",
    "1. `Get-Command`: It lists all the commands available. It has additional parameters like `-Noun` and `-Verb` to get the desired searched command.\n",
    "2. `Update-help`: This command is used to update the `get-help` command.\n",
    "2. `Get-Help`: It provides help for a specific commands. It gives synopsis, syntax, description, related links, and remarks. To get more information about a command, use `Get-Help command -full`, `Get-Help command -showWindow`, `Get-Help command -detailed`, `Get-Help command -example` or `Get-Help command -online`.  \n",
    "**Note**:  \n",
    "`Get-Help` can also be used to find command by searching for a specific word in description of that command. For example: `Get-Help *shutdown*`.  \n",
    "Parameters in square brackets ([]) are optional parameters. For example:\n",
    "![help-command.png](help-command.png)\n",
    "**Path parameter is optional, but its corresponding `string[]` is compulsory. Similarly destination parameter and its value is optional, along with resurse parameter. Also if a parameter value has space in between then include the value in single/double quotes.**\n",
    "3. `Get-Member`: It provides members for output objects of a command.\n",
    "4. `Get-Alias`: It provides the list of aliases in cmdlet. For example: `dir` and `ls` are aliases for `get-childItem`.\n",
    "5. `New-Alias`: It is used to create new aliases.\n",
    "6. `Copy-item`: It copies source into destination. The source can be file or folder. If source has recursive data (i.e, all the folders and files in that folder), then use the parameter `-recurse` for recursive copying."

    "1. Powershell scripts can be written in notepad or in Powershell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment).\n",
    "2. Execution powershell script by double clicking it is disabled by default. To run the script we have to use `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command and then provide the full path of the script (relative: .\\Desktop or absolute: C:\\Users\\Desktop) to execute.\n",

    "    1. **Restricted**: We will not be able to execute any powershell scripts.\n",
    "    2. **Unrestricted**: All powershell scripts can be executed wheather from net or localhost. (This is not recommended).\n",
    "    3. **RemoteSigned**: All locally generated scripts and all scripts which are digitally signed can be executed in powershell.\n",
    "    4. **AllSigned**: All scripts should be digitally signed, wheather local or externally downloaded.\n",
